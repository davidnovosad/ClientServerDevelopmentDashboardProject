# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable it is important to create separate library modules (in our case the CRUD Python module) where we can define functions that are used throughout the main code. 
These functions can be referenced throughout the project without having to re-type the same code over and over again. This makes the code easier to read and functions easier to maintain.
Thanks to this approach we can also adapt by updating the function instead of going through the code and manually updating it wherever the code was used. We can also create new functions and simply add them to the CRUD module.
In my opinion, this is a simple and fundamental way of coding and should be used whenever it is possible. It simplifies the code, makes it easier to notice errors and fix them, and can be used in other projects as well.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I try to approach problems logically as a computer scientist. I noticed in my everyday life that I think of things as if they are represented as a code and try to logically repair them or analyze them.
When approaching the requirements given to me by Grazioso Salvare, I analyzed what would be the best way to develop the code and maintain it as well. Then, with the logic and requirements,
I developed the CRUD Python module that can be used by simply importing the class that contains the functions and those are used to retrieve animals from the shelters database and search through them.
I would try to use the same strategies and techniques since they worked very well for me and I was able to develop the code to meet the client's requirements.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
The main purpose of the computer scientist is to develop well-functioning software that the customer/ company is happy with. This consists of multiple steps.
First, the scientist needs to analyze and document the requirements. Second, the design is created, communicated with the company, and approved. The third and last is the development of the software followed by the testing and deployment.
This type of work on a project of this kind can help me understand the needs and requirements of the company on a deeper level.
Furthermore, I gained valuable experiences that will allow me to give my best to the company. The company will get its needs fulfilled and therefore can improve its offerings to customers, its relationship with them, and allow the business to blossom.
